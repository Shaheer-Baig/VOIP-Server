# VOIP-Server
This Python-based VoIP server enables real-time voice communication over a local network. It manages user authentication, session handling, and voice transmission using standard VoIP protocols. The server registers users upon login and checks if the recipient is online before initiating a call. If the recipient is available, a session is established using SIP over TCP, ensuring proper signaling and call management. Once the session is active, voice data is transmitted in real time using RTP over UDP for efficient and low-latency communication. The session terminates when the call ends. Built using Python and socket programming, this project demonstrates fundamental VoIP communication concepts, including session management and real-time data transfer. It serves as a learning tool for those interested in VoIP systems and network-based communication. Contributions and improvements are welcome.

## Introduction
This project implements a VoIP server using Python alongside Asterisk, an open-source VoIP server. The server enables real-time voice communication over an IP network by handling user registration, authentication, session initiation via SIP over TCP, and voice transmission using RTP over UDP.

## Principles of VoIP
VoIP works by converting analog voice signals into digital data packets, which are transmitted over an IP network. Key steps include:
1. **Analog-to-Digital Conversion** – Converting voice signals into digital format using codecs.
2. **Compression** – Reducing the size of voice data for efficient transmission.
3. **Packetization** – Dividing voice data into packets with headers for routing.
4. **Transmission** – Sending packets over an IP network.
5. **Reassembly & Decoding** – Reconstructing and decoding packets at the receiver’s end.

## VoIP Architecture and Components
### Core Components
- **End Devices**: Softphones, IP phones, or traditional phones with adapters.
- **Gateways**: Interface between IP networks and traditional telephony.
- **Servers**: Handle call signaling, authentication, and routing.
- **Protocols**: Standards like SIP for call setup and RTP for media transmission.

### Protocols and Standards
- **SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)**: Establishes, manages, and terminates calls.
- **RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol)**: Handles real-time transmission of voice and video data.

## Advantages of VoIP
1. **Cost Savings** – Lower costs for long-distance calls.
2. **Scalability** – Easy to expand the network.
3. **Flexibility** – Integration with other communication systems.
4. **Mobility** – Access from any internet-connected device.
5. **Advanced Features** – Voicemail, call forwarding, and conference calling.

## Real-World Applications
1. **Enterprise Communication** – Integrated with email and messaging.
2. **Telemedicine** – Remote consultations with VoIP.
3. **Call Centers** – Efficiently managing customer support calls.
4. **Residential Use** – Affordable home voice communication.
5. **Education** – Remote learning platforms using VoIP.

## Implementation Overview
### Network Requirements
- High-speed internet connection.
- QoS mechanisms for prioritizing voice traffic.

### Hardware and Software
- IP phones or softphones.
- Asterisk VoIP server software.

### Configuration Steps
1. Install and configure the Asterisk VoIP server.
2. Set up user accounts and extensions.
3. Test call setup, routing, and features.

## Server and Client Code Implementation
### UDP Implementation
- **Server**: Uses a UDP socket to listen for incoming voice packets, process them, and transmit them to the recipient.
- **Client**: Streams voice data using PyAudio and sends it over a UDP socket.

### Code Snippets
#### Server:
```python
server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
server_socket.bind((HOST, PORT))
data, addr = server_socket.recvfrom(BUFF_SIZE)
server_socket.sendto(data, target_address)
```

#### Client:
```python
client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
client_socket.sendto(audio_data, (SERVER_HOST, SERVER_PORT))
received_data, server = client_socket.recvfrom(BUFF_SIZE)
```

### Code Explanation
- **Server Code**: Handles authentication, session management, and real-time voice transmission.
- **Client Code**: Connects to the server, initiates calls, and streams audio using PyAudio.

## Asterisk as VoIP Server
Asterisk was used to set up and manage VoIP sessions. It facilitates call processing, SIP communication, and media routing.
### Configuration Files
#### `pjsip.conf`
- Defines SIP users and transport mechanisms.

#### `extensions.conf`
- Maps extensions to call handling logic.

#### `voicemail.conf`
- Configures voicemail boxes for users.

### Call Flow
1. **Registration** – Users register with Asterisk using SIP credentials.
2. **Call Initiation** – Calls are routed based on `extensions.conf`.
3. **Media Transmission** – Voice is streamed via RTP.
4. **Voicemail** – Calls are redirected to voicemail if unanswered.

## Conclusion
This VoIP project demonstrates real-time voice communication using Python and Asterisk. It showcases the power of SIP for session management and RTP for media transmission. VoIP continues to evolve, offering cost-effective, flexible, and scalable communication solutions.
